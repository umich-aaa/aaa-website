                                    A: We have a variety of basic tools available to us: a sewing machine, a variety of threads and needles, scissors and a seam ripper, and lots of foam, but the biggest resource that we can offer are members who are experienced in the craft! Please note that we do not have the budget to provide more project-specific consumables like fur or other fabric.

                                    A: It's as much of a commitment as you want it to be!
